# Privacy Policy for RotationTimer

**Last Updated:** _11/16/2025_

## Introduction
RotationTimer (“the App”) is an Apple Watch application designed to provide periodic vibration alerts based on user-selected time intervals. We value your privacy and are committed to being transparent about our data practices. This Privacy Policy explains what information is (and is not) collected when you use the App.

## Information We Do Not Collect
RotationTimer does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal information or user data.

Specifically:

- We do **not** collect personal identifiers such as your name, email, Apple ID, or device ID.  
- We do **not** collect health data, location data, usage data, or analytics.  
- We do **not** track user activity inside or outside the App.  
- We do **not** use cookies or similar tracking technologies.  
- No data is ever transmitted off your device to our servers or to any third party.

## How the App Works
RotationTimer functions entirely on your device:

- The timer and vibration functions occur locally on your Apple Watch.  
- The App uses only system-level functionality required to run a timer and send haptic feedback.  
- No information entered or generated within the App leaves the device.

## Third-Party Services
RotationTimer does **not** integrate with or use any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## Children’s Privacy
Since RotationTimer collects no data from any user, it does not knowingly collect, store, or process the personal information of children under 13 (or the relevant age of digital consent in your region).

## International Use
RotationTimer is available globally at no cost. Because the App collects no personal information, its use does not involve cross-border data transfers.

## Security
While the App collects no data, we remain committed to ensuring the safety and security of users. All operations take place solely on the device and rely on Apple’s secure watchOS environment.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
If we ever change our data practices or introduce features that require data collection, we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly. Any changes will be posted with an updated “Last Updated” date.
